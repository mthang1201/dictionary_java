<!-- ## Acknowledgements
[Lazy Foo's SDL tutorials](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php) have been extremely helpful, look into them if you are interested in low-level game programming or just want a framework to handle basic graphics for your C/C++ programs.

[An Introduction to Modern CMake](https://www.willusher.io/sdl2%20tutorials/2014/03/06/lesson-0-cmake) is great for learning the basics of CMake and avoiding bad practices.

[Codergopher's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2RPjWnJduNmXHRYwdtublIPdlqocBoLS) was my initial inspiration for starting this project.
